# Overview

Lab 33 is a handy dandy budget tracker that tracks categories and lists expenses.


# Getting Started

To use the Lab 33 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager) will need to be locally installed.  Once Node.js and npm have been 
installed, install the Lab 33 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab 33 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab 33 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run locally.  To locally run this application, the user will have to run `npm 
 run watch` the terminal command line.  Then the application will run on your local browser at an
 address of localhost:8080.   


# Architecture

This application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, React, Redux, babel, jest, eslint, JavaScript
